## a suggestion box for brainy ideas

### Overview

* You start with a seedling :seedling: of an idea (a coffee seedling, because good research requires good fuel!).
* This seedling passes into a "budding" process that involves you, the author of this idea, formalizing it with a GH issue; at the end of this "budding" process, your seedling is more robust and its coffee beans can be harvested.
* Your coffee beans now enter a "roasting" process where they are submitted to external elements, much like roasting coffee beans to bring out their best flavor. During this process, your labmates and collaborators can comment on the open GitHub issue to share their thoughts, raise concerns, etc.
* The last stage in the process is "brewing" a quaffable cup of coffee. Here, you refine your original idea in light of the group discussion.
* Finally, you and the PI enjoy the coffee :coffee: together (figuratively-speaking) as you formally pitch the idea to the PI as a prospective undertaking for the lab.

### How-To

**Budding**

1. Use one of the issue templates available in this repo (there is one for papers and one for code/tools/instruments) to open a new issue. Take your time in formalizing your thoughts. While you work on the issue, it will live in the "Budding" pipeline on the brainBox ZenHub workflow.

**Roasting**

2. Create a new branch within the brainBox repo. Name it: `[project shortname]-[your name]`. For example: `choco-factory-charlie`. Add a new directory (subfolder) under the `brainy-ideas` directory. The project shortname that you use for the GitHub issue, the shortname that you use for the new branch, and the shortname that you use for the sub-directory should be identical.
3. On your branch, within your project subfolder in the `brainy-ideas` directory, create a readme file. Use this file to build out and refine your idea.  This can start as a duplication of the content of your issue. 
4. When you are ready, move the issue into the "Roasting" pipeline; open your idea up for group discussion by tagging the lab (@labwide) on the issue.
5. Watch and respond to the questions that come in. Feel free to remind certain individuals to comment with their thoughts (by tagging them individually) if you feel they would have particularly valuable expertise to hone your idea.
6. As you refine the idea, update the readme in your subdirectory of `brainy-ideas` on your own, speciifc branch. Think of the issue as the conversation and the readme as the work-in-progress.

**Brewing**

7. As your idea takes full shape, move the issue into the "Brewing" pipeline. Craft a clear pitch for the PI's approval using the pull request template.
8. Use [Calendly](https://calendly.com/gbuzzell/30-minute-meeting) to pre-set a meeting with the PI, at least two days after you intend to submit the pull request on GitHub.
9. Submit the pull request on GitHub by adjusting the details on the default pull request form.
10. Get excited to discuss how to make your idea a reality!
