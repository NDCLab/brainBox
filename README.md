## a suggestion box for brainy ideas

### Overview
* You start with a seedling :seedling: of an idea (a coffee seedling, because good research requires good fuel!).
* This seedling passes into a "budding" process that involves you, the author of this idea, formalizing the with a GH issue; at the end of this "budding" process, your seedling is a more robust and the coffee beans can be harvested
* Your coffee beans now enter a "roasting" process where they are submitted to external elements, much like roasting coffee beans to bring out their best flavor. During this process, your labmates and collaborators can comment on the open GitHub issue to share their thoughts, raise concerns, etc.
* The last stage in the process is "brewing" a quaffable cup of coffee. Here, you refine your original idea in light of the team discussion.
* You and George enjoy the coffee :coffee: together (figuratively-speaking) as you formally pitch the idea to him as a prospective undertaking for the lab.

### How-To
1. Use one of the issue templates available in this repo (there is one for papers and one for code/tools/instruments) to open a new issue. Take your time in formalizing your thoughts. While you work on the issue, it will live in the "Budding" pipeline on the brainBox ZenHub workflow.
2. If you will need or want to store specific files with your idea, such as diagrams, create a directory within the brainBox repo. Name it: [project shortname]-[your name]. For example: "choco-factory-charlie".
3. When you are ready, move the issue into the "Roasting" pipeline and open your idea up for group discussion by tagging the lab.
4. Watch and respond to the questions that come in. Feel free to remind certain individuals to share their thoughts if you feel they would have particularly valuable expertise to hone the idea.
5. As the idea takes full shape, move the issue into the "Brewing" pipeline. Craft a clear pitch for George's approval.
6. Use Calendly to pre-set a meeting with George, at least two days after you intend to submit the pull request on GitHub.
7. Submit the pull request on GitHub by adjusting the details on the default pull request form.
8. Get excited to discuss your idea and talk about making it a reality!
