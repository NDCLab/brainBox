Many factors are contributing to the alarming decline in the worldwide dolphin population.  Noise pollution is one major contributor.  Noise pollution refers to the underwater sounds of boat traffic, naval sonar, torpedo testing, and offshore construction.  All this unnatural, man-made noise is very stressful to dolphins.  It interferes with how they communicate and navigate, and can even prove fatal: in some cases, dolphins swim to the surface too quickly to escape all the racket.  Surfacing too quickly can cause decompression sickness, which creates nitrogen bubbles in the body and can lead to paralysis.

Dolphins, like orcas and belugas, have amazing vocal abilities.  They produce a fascinating array of vocalizations, including whistles, pulse sounds, and clicks.  Dolphin clicks are special; created by an organ called a “melon,” clicks are used for echolocation and give dolphins biosonar powers.  Bottlenose dolphins, the “classic” black-and-white dolphin, have signature whistles, unique to each specific individual.  They develop their own signature whistle in their first year and use it for their whole lifetime.  Bottlenose dolphins recognize each others’ whistles and address another dolphin by mimicking his or her signature whistle.
