The mantis shrimp is an aggressive crustacean who lives alone and leaves its burrow primarily to hunt and feed. There are two categories of mantis shrimp: “smashers” and “spearers.” “Spearers” have spiny, barbed forelimbs that they use to stab and snag their prey. “Smashers” bludgeon their future meals with a large club-like appendage. This terrifying weapon strikes at speeds over 50 miles per hour; it is so fast that it creates bubbles in the water around the intended prey. The mantis shrimp’s poor victim is hit twice: first by the claw and then by the shockwave, either of which is deadly.

The need to dominate in close-range combat may be the origin of the most dazzling and complex visual system ever discovered. Two eyeballs are mounted on stalks and move independently of each other; each eyeball also has its own trinocular vision. Together, these visual advantages provide the mantis shrimp with excellent depth perception. What’s more, some species of mantis shrimp have 16 types of photoreceptor cells, giving them the power to perceive an immense rainbow of color, from deep ultraviolet to far red. Many mantis shrimp are brightly colored themselves, such as the attractive and prized peacock mantis. These crustaceans use color like a special language during mating rituals, actively illuminating themselves in vibrant, florescent colors that only other mantis shrimp can see.
