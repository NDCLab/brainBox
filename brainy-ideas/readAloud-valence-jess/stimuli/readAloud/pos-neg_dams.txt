A dam is a gateway that is designed to direct the flow of water. The first known dam was built in Jordan over 5000 years ago. An important ambition in the construction of a dam is to provide sufficient water, both for drinking and for cultivating local farmland. In modern history, this water has also been employed for its hydropower capabilities and dams have become a significant generator of electricity. Humans build these structures, but so do beavers. Using tree branches and vegetation to form their quirky lodges, beavers create an infrastructure that contributes positively to local wetlands.

Dams are an incredible invention. When they fail, the consequences can be catastrophic. Sudden flooding can lead to costly damage to buildings and even death in the nearby population. Failures are typically caused by a poor design leading to a structural breach. The risk of disastrous flooding is not the only downside to dams. New dams drastically degrade rivers, causing the loss of entire ecosystems and the endangered species who occupy them. For example, the Chinese river dolphin was forced into extinction in part due to construction of the Three Gorges Dam. It is not always apparent whether the benefits of dams are adequate to outweigh their destructive repercussions.
