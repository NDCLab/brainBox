Dolphins are majestic, highly-intelligent sea creatures who mostly prefer warmer, tropical waters.  A thick layer of blubber helps with buoyancy, keeps them warm in cooler waters or deeper depths, and serves to streamline their flexible bodies.  They have excellent hearing, which is adapted for both air and water.  Sociable, playful, and altruistic, dolphins live in pods of up to a dozen individuals.  In Greek mythology, dolphins were esteemed as the helpers of humankind.  Seeing dolphins swimming in the wake of a ship was considered a good omen by the Ancient Greeks and many ancient coins pictured a young man riding on the back of a dolphin.

The devastating decline in the dolphin population over the past several decades has alarmed many scientists.  Some researchers estimate that, in the Indian Ocean alone, the current number of dolphins is only 13% of what it was in 1980, a mortality rate that they consider “unsustainable.”  By far the worst culprit is fishing gear, particularly gillnets.  Hundreds of thousands of dolphins have died in these massive nets, which have been banned by the United Nations.  Gillnets are rectangular, impenetrable barriers in the ocean, stretching up to 50 miles long and 20 meters deep.  Like a wall of netting, gillnets entangle their intended prey, with many dolphins accidentally caught in the trap.
