Dolphins are highly-intelligent sea creatures who mostly prefer warmer, tropical waters.  A thick layer of blubber helps with buoyancy and serves to streamline their flexible bodies.  They have excellent hearing, which is adapted for both air and water.  Sociable and playful, dolphins live in pods of up to a dozen individuals.  In Greek mythology, dolphins were esteemed as the helpers of humankind.  Seeing dolphins swimming in the wake of a ship was considered a good omen by the Ancient Greeks and many ancient coins pictured a young man riding on the back of a dolphin.

Over the past several decades, the devastating decline in the dolphin population has been the cause of grave alarm.  This precipitous drop has been provoked by many factors, particularly noise pollution.  Noise pollution refers to the underwater sounds of boat traffic, torpedo testing, and offshore drilling.  All this unnatural noise is very stressful to dolphins.  It interferes with how they navigate and can even prove fatal: in some cases, dolphins rush to the surface to avoid all the racket.  Surfacing too hastily can cause decompression sickness, an illness induced by dissolved nitrogen in the body and which can lead to paralysis and death.
