**Question:**
How does semantic valence interact with cognitive control in a real-world context?

**Hypotheses:**
*Behavioral Effects of Valence*
**Hypothesis 1:** Positivity advantage would impact reading speed and error rate in valenced passages with faster speeds and fewer errors in positive passages than negative passages.

- Are there differences in reading speed between negatively and positively valenced passages? Does presentation order matter?
- Are there differences in the error rate (anticipatory errors, perseverations, etc.) between negatively and positively valenced passages? Does presentation order matter?

**Hypothesis 2:** Semantic priming effects would benefit positive>negative switches more than negative>positive, with a greater likelihood of hesitation or articulatory error at a negative>positive switch than a positive>negative switch.

- Is the hesitation rate at switches different between positive>negative and negative>positive switches?
- Are there increased articulatory errors around one type of switch?  Given that participants will have access to all the text and may "read ahead" to begin encoding, we may need to look at the words prior to the switch, the switch itself, and the words immediately following the switch.

*Conflict Monitoring and Instantiation of Control*
**Hypothesis 3:** Semantic integration of valenced words, when switching suddenly between a positive/neutral word set to a negative word (or vice versa), would show similar neural activity to that deployed during instantiation of cognitive control at the identification of a conflict, with recruitment of proactive control after the recognition potential but before onset of articulation of the switch word, and this should be more pronounced when switching from an individual's current mood state to the reverse; when increased control is absent, we would expect an increased likelihood of articulatory error on or around the switch word.

- Do we see increased MFC-LFC connectivity after presentation of the valence switch but before onset of articulation? If so, is likelihood of articulatory error decreased around the switch word?
- Do we see any difference in MFC-LFC connectivity at presentation of positive>negative versus negative>positive valence switches? Is there a relationship with the participant's self-assessed mood state?

*Inhibitory Control and Mood Incongruence*
**Hypothesis 4:** Affect serves as a "filter" through which an individual experiences the world; therefore, incongruence between the individual's mood state and the valence of words to be read aloud would force some level of inhibitory control in order to ignore one's mood state while encoding and articulating valenced words.

- If valenced section of a passage is incongruent with the participant's current baseline mood, is greater proactive control deployed or, in the absence of increased control, a rise in articulatory mistakes observed?
- Given the importance of affect on social interactions, do we replicate Buzzell et al.'s (2019) finding that only error monitoring is up-regulated in the social condition or do we also find up-regulation of conflict monitoring, either at a switch word (stimulus internal conflict) or when incongruence between word valence and participant's mood state is increased (delta between ANEW score of switch word and participant's self-assessed mood score)?

*Exploratory*
Are we able to see the recognition potential of each word in a reading aloud task?  If so, is there any difference in amplitude between positive, negative, and neutral words?  Do we see any difference in recognition potential amplitude when the participant recognizes a valence switch word?  Does switch direction have any impact on amplitude?

**Lit Review:**
(See literature/lit-review.xlsx.)

Emotion has modulatory effects on cognition and behavior, with processing advantages often seen for positive, visually-presented words:

- slower processing of negative stimuli (versus positive) as seen by slower response time on negative target words in lexical decision tasks (Kazanas and Altarriba (2015))
- positive primes in lexical decision tasks ostensibly cause spreading activation in the semantic network, thereby shortening response time for related target words but slowing response for unrelated target words; negative primes seem to cause an emotional reaction inhibition that precludes any change in response time for related/unrelated targets but enables faster processing for unrelated targets than a positive prime, with its larger network activation (Sass et al. (2012))
- smaller N400 amplitudes for pleasant v. unpleasant adjectives in silent reading may indicate that pleasant words are semantically-integrated more easily, possibly as a result of congruency with default, mildly positive mood states (Herbert et al. (2008))

EEG evidence has linked to inhibitory control and social motivation in the classic flanker test:

- greater MFC-LFC connectivity before a response is linked to reactive control and improved performance on current task whereas greater MFC-LFC connectivity after a response is linked to proactive control and improved performance for the following task (Buzzell et al. (2019))
- social motivation increases error monitoring, not conflict monitoring (Buzzell et al. (2019))

Further research still required on:

- prior EEG work involving affect/valence,
- prior work involving the N400 ERP,
- the recognition potential.

**Design:**
Using the read-aloud task from rwe-alpha, special texts are created that are designed to evoke certain mood states in the reader (positive/negative) and include a valence "switch point" where the mood of the text suddenly reverses. (See stimuli/pos-neg_dolphins.txt for an example.) Requests for [ANEW and ANET](https://csea.phhp.ufl.edu/media.html) have been submitted to assist in text design.  This initial study would only include one switch per text and neutral texts would be placed between valenced texts in order to "reset" the participant's mood state.  (If hypotheses are borne out, future studies could increase the number of switches to determine how many words are necessary to build up a given mood state during the reading aloud task.)

This research project was originally conceived as a spin-off of rwe-alpha with a separate text set. However, the counterbalancing on rwe-alpha is quite complex and adding a second set of texts plus EEG to the existing protocol seems ill-advised.  Therefore, this project may need to be it's own "Part 1B," but could easily be connected to Part 1A for the three studies launched in June 2021.

In addition, I would like to add a measure of current mood state in order to assess whether the impact of the textual mood states (and switches) is impacted by the participant's mood at the time of reading. One existing open-source option is the [Brief Mood Introspective Scale (BMIS)](https://mypages.unh.edu/jdmayer/brief-mood-introspection-scale-bmis). However, as the intent is to actually *modify* participant mood states during reading and then surprise them with a switch, it would be useful to gather the participant's mood multiple times during the task and the BMIS is too cumbersome for repeated use. A simpler instrument, such as the self-designed and color-coded "mood check" (see instruments/mood-check.png) could potentially be used in place of or in combination with the BMIS.

**Funding:**
Require guidance on short-term funding. Some longer-term possibilities include:

- NIH R03
- NIH R21 (for greater RWE)
- NSF CogNeuro
- NSF PAC (Perception, Action & Cognition)
