## brainy-ideas

On the `main` branch, this directory is empty. However, on other branches, this directory contains sub-directories for brainBox ideas that:
* are currently working through the brainBox process (individually named branches)
* have graduated to a standalone repo (`glug-glug`)
* have been allowed to go dormant (`stale`).
